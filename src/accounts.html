    <p class="artiststatement" >My art is all over the place but I like to try and explore everything. From painting to sculpting to metal working or 3D printing I'm interested in it all. I want to create a large skill set for myself so when I have an idea I can create every aspect of that project. I like to do a lot of digital designing with 3D softwares and create those ideas into physical objects, or use different technologies to enhance my art. I used to hate technology and was overwhelmed by it, now I use some sort of tech in almost all my art pieces. Whether it's for planning a construction, modeling it, creating the overall image, or creating extra pieces for the artwork, some sort of tech is involved. I also have a very specific character design I like to work with in hopes of creating a brand with it. In the future I want to print on clothing and other fabrics to see how my ideas translate over to wearable items. </p>

    <p class="artiststatement" > I have always loved art since I can remember, and my grandmother paid for my first art lessons when I was a little girl. I will try any medium! Since starting college, my favorite mediums have been oil paint and charcoal. Recently, I have studied Franchesca Woodman in my film photography class; she has inspired me to take self portraits where I dress up and go to alluring locations.  </p>

        <p class="artiststatement" > Through my art I like to explore different styles and mediums to convey different ideas and emotions. My goal through my art is really just to create and enjoy the process. Of course I hope people enjoy some of my work and it resonates with viewers but I really just create for myself and continue to work on improving. I have always really enjoyed getting creative and being able to put my thoughts on paper which I hope shows through my art. I like to not take myself too seriously and have fun with my work and I hope itâ€™s enjoyable to view. :)  </p>

            <p class="artiststatement" > Poetry has always been my main creative outlet. I have been writing poetry ever since I learned about it in elementary school. The way we can combine words to create an entire atmosphere within just a few lines has always been super intriguing to me. I find that I tend to write a lot about the balance between light and darkness, how in our own lives we all experience good and bad, sometimes simultaneously, and I think trying to put that into words can be very difficult. But with poetry I can create these metaphors and images that help me to better understand these situations and how to navigate my own feelings towards them. My goal is to create poems that have a different meaning to everyone who reads them depending on their own life experiences, while some of my work is very personal and talking about some of the darker things I have experienced, I hope that someone someday will read my work and feel as though someone gets what they are going through.  </p>
